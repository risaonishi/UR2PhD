No, this post is not a problem. The title "major change" and the body "hey guys! can anyone tell me how hard it is to switch from cnas undeclared to business econ? i have an appointment with my advisor today and iâ€™m actually really nervous" do not indicate that the poster is experiencing a problem. The poster is simply asking for advice on how to switch majors.
