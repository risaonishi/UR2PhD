Looking for a Roommate (girl),"Hi! I’m looking for a roommate (girl) for a 2bed 2bath at alight! I already renewed my lease but my current roommate is going to move out after this year so im looking for another roommate to take her place!

you get your own bathroom and closet, and there is an in unit washer and dryer. the apartment is on the second floor and it takes me 10 minutes to scooter to campus. The apartment is fully furnished. 

If you’re worried about safety they do have gates around the apartments, but the parking garage does look scary imo so if you have a car, I would try to get reserved parking instead of garage parking.

Rent is currently $1,319 per month + utilities and is from August 2024-August 2025. You are able to renew the lease if you’d like to stay or sublease it. 

message me if you’d like more details or want to see the apartment!
