CHASS to CNAS,"has anyone switched chass to cnas in their second year? I'm trying to change but an advisor said they won't let me because I'll be over 90 units. i didnt know once you got 90 units youre just not allowed, i just know its a bit more difficult since you have to take more classes (which i was completely fine with). 

plus my advisor (i spoke to another one) said that i can change anytime I just have to follow the major change criteria WHICH IVE BEEN DOING. the one i talked to was like ""yeah... no.""

why is it so hard to switch majors?? did anyone have this problem? and its so hard to get classes because they fill up in 10 seconds."

I‚Äôm admitted to UC Riverside for an engineering major as an incoming freshman, but some of my recent experiences have led me to want to pursue cs instead. I was wondering how hard it would be to transfer since I‚Äôm already in bcoe, hopefully from someone who has done it. Also, I see that there‚Äôs a ‚Äúmajor change‚Äù tab in my portal. If I selected cs there, is it guaranteed? Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you."
